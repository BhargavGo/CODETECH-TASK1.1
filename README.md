# **Overview of the Project**

## **Project : LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO USING EMBEDDED C PROGRAMMING**

### **Objective**
The primary objective of translating the Arduino-based program into Embedded C is to provide a more direct, efficient, and low-level control over the microcontroller's hardware resources. 

This approach allows for:

1.Optimized Performance: Direct register manipulation can reduce overhead and improve execution speed.

2.Better Resource Management: Embedded C enables fine-grained control over memory and processing power, which is crucial for resource-constrained environments.

3.Portability Across Different Platforms: Embedded C programs can be adapted to various microcontroller families (e.g., AVR, PIC, ARM) with minimal changes, whereas Arduino code is specific to the Arduino environment.
